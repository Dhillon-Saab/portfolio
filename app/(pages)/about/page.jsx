      Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Amrit Singh Dhillon, and I
      am a software development student and graphics designer. I am passionate
      about both fields and have been honing my skills for several years.
      <br />
      <br />
      As a software development student, I have experience in Java, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, JS, React, Next.js, Mobile App Dev
      and I enjoy working on projects that involve developing software
      solutions for real-world problems. Some of my notable software projects
      include chat-rooms, API based Applications.
      <br />
      <br />
      As a graphics designer, I specialize in 3D Modelling, Character
      Designing, Realistic Renders, and I enjoy creating visually appealing
      designs that communicate a message effectively.
      <br />
      <br />
      My passion for software development and graphics design drives me to
      learn more and continually improve my skills. I am always looking for
      opportunities to collaborate with others and to take on challenging
      projects that help me grow as a professional.
      <br />
      <br />
      In addition to my technical skills, I am an excellent communicator and
      team player. I understand the importance of effective communication and
      collaboration in both software development and graphics design projects.
      <br />
      <br />
      Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. Please feel free to
      explore my portfolio and get in touch if you have any questions or would
      like to discuss a potential project.
